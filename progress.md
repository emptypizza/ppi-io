Original prompt: Implement PPI.io as a separate public repository from ppi at 7b6e1a3, using Canvas2D, Cloudflare Workers Free + SQLite Durable Objects, two ten-slot rooms, equal PvP stats, free quota admission stops, PC browsers, and separate practice progression.

## Work log

- Imported tracked baseline into a new independent repository; original ppi remains unchanged.
- Parallel implementation: pure simulation, Canvas client/practice economy, Worker/DO lifecycle and quota control.
- Root integrates protocol, build tooling, tests, GitHub repository/Pages, deployment guard and verification.
- Created public repository https://github.com/emptypizza/ppi-io with independent baseline commit6208aa8.
- Implemented pure60Hzsimulation, Canvas client, isolated practice economy, server-authoritative rooms, quota reservations, Turnstile/auth and lifecycle handling.
- Unit51 + actual workerd9 passed; production build~65KB before gzip. Dependency audit0 known vulnerabilities.
- Two-browser online smoke passed locally.20protocol-client/2room soak passed71,169ms and2rounds after jitter-tolerant10Hz token-bucket correction.
- Chromium andWebKit UI/practice passed, fullscreens inspected. Firefox failed before page creation; actualSafari/Edge remain unverified.
- Free-only deploy wrapper correctly refuses deployment without Cloudflare login.
- GitHub Pages configured to deploy validated build via Actions; public config has empty API/sitekey until actualFreeaccount setup.

## External prerequisites

- User has no Cloudflare account. Account signup, email verification and login are required for managed online deployment.
- Require confirmed Workers Free before deployment; no paid upgrades.
- Public PvP on two actual devices/networks remains a deployment verification gate.
- OAuth device login requested from user; never share provider tokens in chat or Git. Public online stays closed until account/Free proof is available.
